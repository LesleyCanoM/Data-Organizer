<h1>File Data Analysis - C++ Project</h1> <h2>Description</h2> This project is a C++ program designed to read numerical data from an input file, perform statistical calculations, and write the results to an output file. The program calculates the highest number, lowest number, sum, and average for a set of numbers. It is efficient and user-friendly, demonstrating skills in file handling, data processing, and statistical operations. This project can be applied in scenarios like analyzing sales data, inventory records, or performance metrics.<br /> <h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>
<b>C++</b>

<b>Standard Library (iostream, fstream)</b>

<h2>Environments Used</h2>
